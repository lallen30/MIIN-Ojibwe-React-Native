echo "üß™ COMMON CAUSES & SOLUTIONS:"
echo ""
echo "1. üåê NETWORK CONNECTIVITY"

echo "   - First-time registration can take 2-5 minutes"
echo "   - Apple Push Notification service can be slow"
echo "   - Solution: Wait longer, try Force Registration button"

echo "3. üÜî ONESIGNAL APP ID VERIFICATION"
echo "   - App ID: 2bf0b7b7-c1ff-478f-a661-9dbb7a5f0965"
echo "   - Should be configured in OneSignal dashboard"
echo "   - Check if iOS certificates are properly uploaded"
echo ""
echo "4. üì± iOS DEVICE REGISTRATION"
echo "   - Development vs Production certificates"
echo "   - Device needs to be registered with Apple Developer account"
