echo "🔄 NEXT STEPS:"

echo "1. Wait 30-60 seconds for OneSignal to complete device registration"
echo "2. In the app, tap '🔄 Refresh Status' button"

echo "🎯 EXPECTED RESULT:"
echo "- User ID should appear within 60 seconds"
echo "- Test notification should arrive within 10-30 seconds"

echo "📋 If User ID doesn't appear after 2 minutes:"
echo "- Check internet connectivity"
echo "- Force close and reopen the app"
echo "- Check OneSignal dashboard for any device registration"

echo "🚀 This is normal behavior - OneSignal needs time to register with Apple Push Notification service!"
