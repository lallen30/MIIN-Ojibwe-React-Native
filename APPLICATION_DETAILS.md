## 3. Navigation Architecture

### 3.1 Navigation Structure

The application employs a hierarchical navigation structure with several key navigators:

- **AppNavigator**: The main navigator that wraps the entire application
  - Provides the entry point to the app with the Login screen as the initial route
  - Contains all pre-login screens (Login, SignUp, ForgotPassword, VerifyEmail, etc.)
  - Navigates to DrawerNavigator after successful login
  
- **DrawerNavigator**: Provides a drawer navigation for post-login screens
  - Includes routes for Home, About Us, Calendar, Profile, etc.
  - Integrates with TabNavigator for bottom tab functionality
  - Handles logout functionality

- **TabNavigator**: Provides bottom tab navigation
  - Contains tabs for Profile, Contact, Home, Calendar, and Menu
  - Used inside the DrawerNavigator to allow both drawer and tab navigation

- **NavigationWrapper**: Provides a wrapper for navigation components
  - Checks for terms and privacy policy updates when navigating between screens
  - Displays alerts when updates are needed
  - Handles navigation monitoring and error handling

### 3.2 Screen Organization

- **PreLogin Screens**:
  - LoginScreen
  - SignUpScreen
  - ForgotPasswordScreen
  - VerifyEmailScreen
  - TermsAndConditionsScreen
  - PrivacyPolicyScreen

- **PostLogin Screens**:
  - HomeScreen
  - AboutUsScreen
  - CalendarScreen
  - EventDetails
  - MyProfileScreen
  - EditProfileScreen
  - ChangePasswordScreen
  - BluestoneAppsAIScreen
  - ContactScreen
  - PostsScreen
  - PostScreen

## 4. Version Management System

### 4.1 Overview

The application implements a sophisticated version management system that handles:
- App version tracking
- Version comparison
- Update notifications
- Terms and Privacy Policy update monitoring
- Version history tracking

### 4.2 Key Components

#### 4.2.1 update-version.js

This script manages version updates across the application:

- Updates version numbers in multiple locations:
  - package.json
  - iOS Info.plist
  - Android build.gradle
  - src/helper/config.ts
  - README.md
- Tracks version history in VERSION_HISTORY.md
- Supports different update types (major, minor, patch)
- Provides detailed console output during the update process
- Includes error handling and reporting

Usage:
```bash
npm run update-version <new-version> [update-type]
```

Example:
```bash
npm run update-version 1.5.0 minor
```

#### 4.2.2 UpdateService

The UpdateService class (src/services/UpdateService.ts) provides the core functionality for app updates:

- **Version Checking**:
  - Fetches the current app version from DeviceInfo
  - Retrieves the latest version from the server API
  - For iOS, also checks the App Store version
  - Compares versions using the compare-versions library

- **Update Management**:
  - Determines if an update is required based on minimum version
  - Tracks skipped versions in AsyncStorage
  - Opens the appropriate app store (iOS or Android) for updates
  - Handles version storage and retrieval

- **Error Handling**:
  - Implements timeout for API requests
  - Provides fallback values when API requests fail
  - Gracefully handles network errors

#### 4.2.3 useAppUpdate Hook

This custom hook (src/hooks/useAppUpdate.ts) encapsulates the update logic for components:

- Manages state for update-related UI elements
- Provides functions for checking updates and opening app stores
- Implements debouncing to prevent excessive update checks
- Tracks when updates were last checked
- Controls the update modal visibility

#### 4.2.4 UpdateModal Component

This component (src/components/UpdateModal.tsx) displays update notifications to users:

- Shows different messages based on update requirements:
  - Required updates (current version < minimum version)
  - Optional updates (current version < latest version)
  - Up-to-date messages
- Provides update and skip options
- Allows users to skip non-critical updates
- Includes error handling for update failures

### 4.3 Terms and Privacy Policy Updates

In addition to app version updates, the system also manages Terms and Privacy Policy updates:

- **NavigationMonitorService**:
  - Tracks when users accept terms and privacy policy updates
  - Compares stored dates with server dates to determine if updates are needed
  - Prevents repeated prompts for the same updates
  - Handles error conditions gracefully

- **NavigationWrapper**:
  - Integrates with NavigationMonitorService to check for updates during navigation
  - Shows alerts when updates are required
  - Navigates users to the appropriate terms or privacy screens

## 5. Application Initialization and Lifecycle

### 5.1 App Startup Flow

1. **Splash Screen Display**:
   - App.tsx displays a splash screen during initialization
   - Loads the splash image and shows a loading indicator
   - Handles image loading errors gracefully

2. **Version Checking**:
   - Checks the current app version against stored version
   - Updates stored version if necessary
   - Logs version changes for tracking

3. **Navigation Setup**:
   - Initializes AppNavigator with appropriate screens
   - Sets up navigation options and animations
   - Configures error boundaries for crash prevention

4. **Update Checking**:
   - HomeScreen performs update checks when mounted
   - Shows update modal if a new version is available
   - Handles terms and privacy policy update checks

### 5.2 Error Handling

The application implements robust error handling:

- **ErrorBoundary Component**:
  - Catches JavaScript errors in component trees
  - Prevents entire app crashes
  - Displays user-friendly error messages

- **Try-Catch Blocks**:
  - Strategic use of try-catch throughout the application
  - Detailed error logging with console.error
  - Fallback UI for error conditions

- **Network Error Handling**:
  - Timeouts for API requests
  - Fallback values when network requests fail
  - Offline mode support where applicable

## 6. API Integration

### 6.1 API Configuration

The application uses a WordPress backend API:
- Base URL configured in src/config/environment.ts
- Endpoints defined in src/helper/config.ts
- Uses JWT authentication for secure API requests

### 6.2 Key API Endpoints

- Authentication: wp-json/jwt-auth/v1/token
- Profile: wp-json/mobileapi/v1/getProfile
- Terms & Privacy: 
  - wp-json/mobileapi/v1/getTermsPublishedDate
  - wp-json/mobileapi/v1/getPrivacyPublishedDate
- App Version: wp-json/mobileapi/v1/app_version

## 7. Recent Improvements and Fixes

According to VERSION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md, several recent improvements have been made:

- Enhanced UpdateService with App Store version checking
- Improved version update script
- Fixed Version Update Modal to show only when needed
- Fixed Terms and Privacy Policy update prompts
- Enhanced error handling throughout the app
- Improved navigation wrapper with better loading indicators
- Fixed various bugs related to version comparison

## 8. Conclusion

The LA React Native application provides a comprehensive template with sophisticated navigation, error handling, and version management. The update-version.js script and associated components form a robust system for tracking and managing app versions across multiple platforms.

This application architecture can be effectively used as a foundation for future apps, with particular attention to the version management system which ensures users always have access to the latest features and security updates.
