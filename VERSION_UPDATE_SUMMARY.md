# Version Management Improvements

## Overview of Changes

We've enhanced the version management system in the React Native app to match the functionality of the Ionic app, with additional improvements for robustness and ease of use.

## Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced UpdateService**
   - Added App Store version checking similar to the Ionic app
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for when API calls fail
   - Added error handling and timeout for network requests
   - Integrated with AsyncStorage for version tracking

2. **Improved Version Update Script**
   - Enhanced the update-version.js script to update all necessary files
   - Added support for tracking version history
   - Implemented better error handling and reporting
   - Added support for different update types (major, minor, patch)

3. **Documentation**
   - Created VERSION_HISTORY.md to track version changes
   - Updated VERSION_UPDATE_README.md with comprehensive instructions
   - Added detailed comments throughout the code

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented robust error handling in the UpdateService
   - Added fallback mechanisms for when version checks fail
   - Ensured the app can function even when update services are unavailable

## Recent Fixes (February 26, 2025)

1. **Fixed Version Update Modal**
   - Corrected the logic in `shouldShowUpdateModal` to only show the update modal when the current version is less than the latest version
   - Updated the UpdateModal component to display appropriate messages based on version comparison
   - Added additional checks in the useAppUpdate hook to prevent showing the modal when versions are the same

2. **Fixed Terms and Privacy Policy Update Prompts**
   - Added logic to store initial dates for terms and privacy policy to prevent constant prompts
   - Implemented internet connection check before making API calls
   - Added better error handling for API failures

## Update 2025-02-27: Fixed Terms, Privacy Policy, and Version Update Issues

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Terms and Privacy Policy Update Prompts**
   - Fixed issue where users were constantly prompted to accept terms and privacy policy updates
   - Implemented proper date storage and comparison logic
   - Added checks to only show prompts when actual updates are available
   - Improved error handling for API failures

2. **Version Update Modal**
   - Fixed issue where the update modal was shown even when no update was available
   - Improved version comparison logic
   - Enhanced update messages to be more informative
   - Added better error handling

### Implementation Details:

#### NavigationMonitorService
- Added a new storage key `terms_privacy_initial_check_completed` to track if initial check was completed
- Improved date comparison logic to only show prompts when server dates are newer than stored dates
- Added robust error handling for API failures
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

#### NavigationWrapper
- Improved the update check process with better error handling
- Enhanced the loading overlay with better styling
- Added more detailed logging

#### UpdateService
- Enhanced the `shouldShowUpdateModal` method to properly compare versions
- Added detailed logging for version comparisons
- Improved error handling

#### UpdateModal
- Added a new `getUpdateMessage` function to display appropriate messages based on version comparison
- Fixed the display logic to show the correct message for each scenario

#### useAppUpdate Hook
- Simplified the version check logic
- Improved error handling
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

## Version Update System Fixes

### Issues Fixed

### 1. `checkForUpdates is not a function (it is undefined)`
- **Problem**: In App.tsx, the code was trying to use a function called `checkForUpdates` from the useAppUpdate hook, but this function wasn't being exported.
- **Solution**: Added `checkForUpdates: checkAppVersion` to the return object in useAppUpdate.ts to create an alias for the existing function.

### 2. `_UpdateService.default getLatestVersionInfo is not a function (it is undefined)`
- **Problem**: The useAppUpdate hook was trying to call `UpdateService.getLatestVersionInfo()`, but this method doesn't exist in the UpdateService class.
- **Solution**: Changed the call to `UpdateService.checkForUpdates()` which is the correct method name in the UpdateService class.
- **Additional Changes**: Updated the VersionInfo interface to match what's returned by UpdateService.checkForUpdates().

### 3. `Property 'compareVersions' doesn't exist`
- **Problem**: The UpdateModal.tsx file was trying to use the compareVersions function directly, but it wasn't imported.
- **Solution**: Added the import for compareVersions from 'compare-versions' in UpdateModal.tsx.
- **Additional Changes**: 
  - Updated the component to manage currentVersion as a state variable.
  - Fixed all the places where we check if an update is required to use the current version.
  - Updated the VersionInfo interface in UpdateModal.tsx to match the one in useAppUpdate.ts.

## Best Practices for Version Management

1. **Version Consistency**: Always ensure that version numbers follow a consistent format (e.g., semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

2. **Error Handling**: Include robust error handling to prevent crashes when network requests fail or when AsyncStorage operations encounter issues.

3. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provide fallback values and mechanisms when external services are unavailable.

4. **Testing**: Regularly test the update flow with different version scenarios (current version higher, equal, or lower than latest/minimum versions).

5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation of your versioning strategy and update requirements to help future developers understand the system.

## Future Improvements

1. **Unified Interfaces**: Consider creating a shared types file for interfaces like VersionInfo to ensure consistency across components.

2. **Automated Testing**: Add unit tests for the update logic to catch regressions early.

3. **Graceful Degradation**: Further enhance the fallback mechanisms to ensure the app remains functional even when update services are unavailable.

## How to Use

### Updating the App Version

```bash
npm run update-version <new-version> [update-type]
```

For example:

```bash
npm run update-version 1.5.0 minor
```

### Checking for Updates

The app automatically checks for updates when it starts. You can also manually trigger an update check:

```javascript
const { checkForUpdates } = useAppUpdate();
checkForUpdates();
```

## Testing

To test the update feature:

1. Update the app version using the update-version.js script
2. Run the app to see if it detects the new version
3. Test different scenarios (required update, optional update, skipped version)

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for beta versions and testing channels
2. Implement A/B testing for update prompts
3. Add analytics to track update conversion rates
4. Enhance the update modal UI with animations and better visuals
