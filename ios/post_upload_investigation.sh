echo "✅ UPLOAD CONFIRMED SUCCESSFUL!"
echo "==============================="
echo "Your archive shows the upload completed successfully:"
echo "• Upload State: SUCCESS ✅"
echo "• Build Number: 1"
echo "• Upload Time: July 1, 2025 22:22:11 UTC"
echo "• App Store ID: 6747951450"

echo ""
echo "🔍 Since upload succeeded but build isn't visible:"
echo "================================================="
echo "The issue is likely one of these specific problems:"

echo ""
echo "🚨 MOST LIKELY CAUSES:"
echo "====================="
echo "1. 📧 SILENT REJECTION - Check your email!"
echo "   • Apple sends rejection emails to developer account email"
echo "   • Common rejections: Invalid icons, missing metadata, compliance issues"
echo "   • Check spam/junk folders too"

echo "2. 🔄 PROCESSING DELAY"
echo "   • Can take up to 90 minutes for complex apps"
echo "   • First-time submissions often take longer"

echo "3. 📱 WRONG TESTFLIGHT SECTION"
echo "   • Check App Store Connect > [Your App] > TestFlight"
echo "   • Look in 'iOS' tab specifically"
echo "   • Check 'Missing Compliance' tab"

echo ""
echo "🛠️  IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:"
echo "========================"
echo "1. 📧 CHECK EMAIL RIGHT NOW"
echo "   • Look for emails from: do_not_reply@email.apple.com"
echo "   • Subject lines often contain: 'App Store Connect'"
echo "   • Check last 2 hours of emails"

echo "2. 🌐 LOG INTO APP STORE CONNECT"
echo "   • Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com"
echo "   • Navigate to: My Apps > [MIIN-Ojibwe App]"
echo "   • Click: TestFlight tab"
echo "   • Check ALL sub-tabs: iOS, Missing Compliance, etc."

echo "3. 🔍 SPECIFIC PLACES TO CHECK:"
echo "   • TestFlight > iOS builds"
echo "   • TestFlight > Missing Compliance"
echo "   • App Store Connect notifications (bell icon)"
echo "   • Activity tab in your app"

echo ""
echo "📱 QUICK VERIFICATION STEPS:"
echo "============================"
echo "1. Open: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/6747951450/testflight"
echo "2. Look for build 1.0.0 (1) in iOS section"
echo "3. If not there, check Missing Compliance tab"
echo "4. Look for any red error indicators"

echo ""
echo "🔧 IF STILL NOT VISIBLE AFTER CHECKING:"
echo "======================================"
echo "1. 📞 Contact Apple Developer Support"
echo "   • Reference your App ID: 6747951450"
echo "   • Upload time: July 1, 2025 22:22:11 UTC"
echo "   • Build: 1.0.0 (1)"

echo "2. 🔄 RE-UPLOAD WITH DIFFERENT BUILD NUMBER"
echo "   • Run: ./fix_version_testflight.sh"
echo "   • Change CFBundleVersion to '2'"
echo "   • Archive and upload again"

echo ""
echo "💡 MOST LIKELY SCENARIO:"
echo "======================="
echo "You have an email rejection that you haven't seen yet."
echo "Check your email thoroughly - this is the #1 cause!"

echo ""
echo "📧 Apple Developer Email Addresses to Check:"
echo "==========================================="
echo "• do_not_reply@email.apple.com"
echo "• app-store-connect@email.apple.com"
echo "• developer@apple.com"

echo ""
echo "✨ The upload definitely succeeded - it's just a matter"
echo "   of finding out why it's not visible in TestFlight!"
