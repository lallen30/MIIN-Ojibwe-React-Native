echo "🔍 ONESIGNAL USER ID REGISTRATION FAILURE ANALYSIS"
echo "=================================================="
echo ""
echo "🚨 CURRENT SITUATION:"
echo "✅ OneSignal SDK initialized successfully"
echo "✅ Notification permissions granted"
echo "✅ Force Registration attempted"
echo "❌ User ID still not appearing after Force Registration"
echo ""
echo "🧪 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:"
echo "This suggests one of these fundamental issues:"
echo ""
echo "1. 🔑 APNs CERTIFICATE PROBLEMS"
echo "   - OneSignal doesn't have valid Apple Push Notification certificates"
echo "   - Development vs Production certificate mismatch"
echo "   - Expired or misconfigured certificates"
echo ""
echo "2. 📱 DEVICE PROVISIONING ISSUES"
echo "   - Device UDID not registered in Apple Developer account"
echo "   - App Bundle ID mismatch with OneSignal configuration"
echo "   - Incorrect provisioning profile"
echo ""
echo "3. 🌐 NETWORK/FIREWALL BLOCKING"
echo "   - Corporate network blocking OneSignal servers"
echo "   - VPN interfering with Apple Push servers"
echo "   - DNS resolution issues"
echo ""
echo "4. ⚙️  ONESIGNAL CONFIGURATION"
echo "   - Incorrect App ID or API keys"
echo "   - iOS bundle ID mismatch in OneSignal dashboard"
echo "   - Development/Production environment mismatch"
echo ""
echo "🔧 IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION STEPS:"
echo ""
echo "Step 1: Check OneSignal Dashboard"
echo "  - Go to: https://app.onesignal.com/apps/2bf0b7b7-c1ff-478f-a661-9dbb7a5f0965"
echo "  - Check 'Settings > Platforms > iOS'"
echo "  - Verify APNs certificates are uploaded and valid"
echo "  - Check Bundle ID matches: $(grep -A1 CFBundleIdentifier ios/LAReactNative/Info.plist | tail -1 | sed 's/.*<string>\(.*\)<\/string>.*/\1/' 2>/dev/null || echo 'Check manually')"
echo ""
echo "Step 2: Verify App Bundle ID"
echo "  - OneSignal dashboard Bundle ID should match iOS app Bundle ID"
echo "  - Check for typos or case sensitivity"
echo ""
echo "Step 3: Test Network Connectivity"
echo "  - Try different WiFi network"
echo "  - Test with cellular data"
echo "  - Disable VPN if using one"
echo ""
echo "Step 4: Check Apple Developer Account"
echo "  - Verify device UDID is registered"
echo "  - Check provisioning profile includes Push Notifications capability"
echo "  - Ensure certificates are not expired"
echo ""
echo "📊 DIAGNOSTIC ALTERNATIVES:"
echo ""
echo "Option A: Test with 'Send to All Users'"
echo "  - Even without User ID, we can test push delivery"
echo "  - OneSignal Dashboard > Messages > Push > Send to All Users"
echo ""
echo "Option B: Check Device Registration in Dashboard"
echo "  - OneSignal Dashboard > Audience > All Users"
echo "  - Look for your device (might show as 'Unsubscribed')"
echo ""
echo "Option C: Use Xcode Console for APNs Logs"
echo "  - Connect device to Mac"
echo "  - Open Xcode > Window > Devices and Simulators"
echo "  - View device logs for APNs registration messages"
echo ""
echo "🎯 NEXT ACTIONS:"
echo "1. Check OneSignal dashboard for iOS certificate status"
echo "2. Verify Bundle ID matches exactly"
echo "3. Try 'Send to All Users' test notification"
echo "4. Report back findings for further investigation"
echo ""
echo "📞 If all above checks pass, the issue is likely:"
echo "   - OneSignal SDK v5 compatibility issue"
echo "   - React Native bridge configuration problem"
echo "   - Need to implement alternative initialization method"
