# React Native App Maintenance Checklist

## Pre-Release Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All console.log statements used for debugging are removed or disabled in production
- [ ] No TODO comments remain in the code
- [ ] Code is properly formatted and follows project style guidelines
- [ ] No unused imports, variables, or functions
- [ ] No hardcoded values that should be in configuration files

### Error Handling
- [ ] All API calls are wrapped in try/catch blocks
- [ ] Error boundaries are implemented for critical components
- [ ] Proper error messages are shown to users
- [ ] Error logging is implemented for debugging
- [ ] Fallback UI is provided for error states

### Performance
- [ ] No memory leaks (all event listeners and subscriptions are cleaned up)
- [ ] Callbacks are memoized where appropriate
- [ ] Large lists use FlatList with proper optimizations
- [ ] Images are properly sized and optimized
- [ ] Heavy computations are memoized or moved to background threads

### Testing
- [ ] App is tested on multiple iOS devices/simulators
- [ ] App is tested on multiple Android devices/emulators
- [ ] App is tested with slow network conditions
- [ ] App is tested with no network connection
- [ ] All user flows are tested manually

### App Configuration
- [ ] App version is updated in all required files
- [ ] API endpoints are correctly configured for the target environment
- [ ] App store information is updated (screenshots, description, etc.)
- [ ] App icons and splash screens are updated if needed
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly for the build

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Weekly
- [ ] Check for dependency updates and security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Review crash reports and error logs
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Check API endpoint health

### Monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Run performance profiling
- [ ] Review and optimize slow components
- [ ] Check for deprecated API usage
- [ ] Review and update documentation

### Quarterly
- [ ] Major dependency updates (React Native, etc.)
- [ ] Code refactoring for improved maintainability
- [ ] Review and update testing strategy
- [ ] Performance audit and optimization
- [ ] Security audit

## Version Update Process

1. **Planning**
   - [ ] Define new features and bug fixes
   - [ ] Create tickets for each task
   - [ ] Estimate effort and timeline

2. **Development**
   - [ ] Create feature branches for each task
   - [ ] Implement changes with proper tests
   - [ ] Conduct code reviews
   - [ ] Merge changes to development branch

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Run automated tests
   - [ ] Perform manual testing
   - [ ] Fix any issues found

4. **Release**
   - [ ] Update version numbers
   - [ ] Create release notes
   - [ ] Build release candidate
   - [ ] Test release candidate
   - [ ] Submit to app stores

5. **Post-Release**
   - [ ] Monitor crash reports
   - [ ] Address any critical issues
   - [ ] Plan for next release

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Blank Screen
- Check if Metro bundler is running
- Check for JavaScript errors in the console
- Verify that the app is properly initialized
- Check for issues in the navigation setup
- Verify that all required assets are available

### Slow Performance
- Look for unnecessary re-renders
- Check for memory leaks
- Optimize image loading and caching
- Reduce JavaScript bridge traffic
- Use performance monitoring tools

### API Connection Issues
- Verify API endpoints are correct
- Check network connectivity
- Verify authentication tokens
- Check for CORS issues (web)
- Implement proper retry mechanisms

### App Crashes
- Check crash reports for stack traces
- Look for unhandled exceptions
- Verify memory usage
- Check for native module issues
- Test on different devices

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./clean-and-restart.sh

# Check for common issues
./debug-app.sh

# Update app version
npm run update-version <new-version>

# Run with reset cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Build for iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# Build for Android
npx react-native run-android
```
